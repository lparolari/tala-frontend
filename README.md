A simple and easy-to-use user interface for analyzing MS Teams attendance lists.

## Introduction

Do you have any doubts that the participants of your meetings do anything else?
Good, TALA is for you.

With TALA you can analyze MS Teams attendance lists and understand the behavior
of the participants to your meetings. I've personally used this tool in order to
understand what my students do during my meeting. Results were kinda
interesting!

## Features

- **Find left outliers**, i.e., who left before or after the participants mean.*
